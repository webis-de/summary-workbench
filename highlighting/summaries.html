                        story
                        takes
                        place, human settlers arrived on the planet where the story takes place, which everyone calls
                        New World.
                        Unfortunately, New World was originally inhabited by an alien species called the Spackle. Of
                        course, the
                        humans and Spackle almost immediately got into a war, with the Spackle fighting their enemies
                        using
                        biological warfare. The humans eventually won, but not before the Spackle released one germ
                        which made
                        all
                        humans telepathic, and another which killed all the women and most of the men. The last few
                        hundred
                        survivors are now stuck in one small village that's slowly dying since no one can have any kids.
                        Fourteen
                        years later, Todd Hewit, the last boy to be born before all the women died, is about to
                        officially
                        become a
                        man. Then, a month before Todd's birthday his parents suddenly tell him he has to run away from
                        the
                        village.
                        Turns out that even in a world where everyone's telepathic, lots of people are keeping secrets

                    <td>I met this girl five years ago. Love at first sight. She quickly became pregnant at 3 months in
                        and I
                        stuck
                        with it. I didn't regret it one bit and I had an excellent life with her until two days ago. The
                        pregnancy
                        went well and we were with a son not too long after. After our child was born, her parents kind
                        of
                        coddled
                        us. They bought us a house, each of us a car, the whole nine. For these five years, life has
                        been great
                        and
                        I am never unappreciative of the opportunity I've been given. Two days ago, my girlfriend was in
                        the
                        kitchen
                        and her phone went off in the other room. She asked me to grab it and check who it was from. It
                        was from
                        Tim, and the short blurb on her homescreen was something along the lines of our child is so
                        handsome. I
                        didn't open her phone to read the full message, but I was kind of hit pretty hard. A little
                        while later
                        I
                        asked my girlfriend who she was texting back and forth and she said Tim's name and I asked her a
                        bit
                        more
                        about him. She was fairly defensive, but not very obviously why are you so curious of a sudden,
                        etc etc
                        but
                        still gave a little bit of info. I dropped it but next time she went to the washroom, I snooped
                        a little
                        just to see their conversation, only to find the convo deleted. I don't know what to think. Part
                        of me
                        is
                        trying to rationalize maybe it was a typo, i.e. your child is so handsome, but at the same time
                        I wonder
                        why
                        she deleted the conversation. Allegedly when our child was conceived, she was in another city
                        visiting a
                        friend. It's something like the conception window was 80 when she was away and 20 when she
                        returned. She
                        did
                        tell me where Tim lived, and it's not where she visited. In the end I just want the truth but I
                        don't
                        know
                        how to approach it. I love my son even if he isn't blood, but I don't want to live in a
                        relationship
                        based
                        under a lie and unfaithfulness. My situation is complicated because of the house, cars, etc, all
                        of it
                        technically in her parents name. If we were to split, my living arrangement would become

                        am always the one initiating conversations throughout the week. And he's the one initiating
                        dates. So
                        basically I will text him, starting a conversation. Then, he will usually ask me when I am free
                        next and
                        then plan a date. We'll continue to text up until said date and then communication dies
                        off.until I text
                        him
                        again. I don't get it. Should I start initiating more dates? He is a busy guy always working, so
                        I
                        understand why he wouldn't initiate more conversations, and some people are not big texters. And
                        he will
                        always respond to my texts, but never quickly, which also allows me to believe he is busy
                        throughout the
                        workday. The other anxious part of me thinks he's just not into me. But it doesn't align with
                        his
                        behavior
                        when we do hang out. I don't know. Should I stop initiating conversations? I feel like I should

                    <td>Hey rrelationshipadvice! I'm currently in my twenties and around two years ago I came out of a
                        three
                        year
                        relationship which came to a mutual break up. I came for my first year in university two years
                        ago.
                        Around
                        2-3 months into school, I met this girl. I really fell for her, we hung out a lot and I guess
                        dated
                        without
                        the idea of being bfgf. She was very busy though for the rest of the post I'll call her Y, so we
                        called
                        it.
                        Y and I dated for around one and a half months. Shortly after I was practically in a one year
                        relationship
                        with another someone who we just weren't meant to be. I ended it around 7 weeks ago. But even
                        though I
                        was
                        in the relationship for a year I thought many times of how much I miss the girl that I first met
                        busy
                        one so
                        around 5 weeks ago I sent Y a text explaining how I really missed having Y in my life, and I
                        really
                        wanted
                        to be friends with Y. I went out on a friendly date with Y yesterday and I instantly caught
                        feelings
                        again.
                        She was being very flirty, however when I dropped her off we didn't kiss or anything like
                        before. She
                        just
                        asked me if I wanted to hangout today, again. Obviously, having a crush on her - I said yes. I
                        feel this
                        crazy chemistry and compatibility with her. What the hell do I do, I really enjoy being around
                        her. I've
                        never had conversations with people like I have with her. We can talk about anything and
                        everything.

                        long, and I like many of you, I'm sure am a sprinter, not an endurance type of student, so I

                        up
                        suddenly
                        with me In September 2017. I did everything for her, i even travelled 3000 miles to see her. UK
                        to USA.
                        But
                        now that we broke up i for some reason cant get over it. Ill admit it was a very one sided
                        relationship,
                        as
                        not much was coming my way but i did everything for her, send her flowers randomly, buy her
                        amazing
                        gifts
                        for christmas and birthday, even just random gifts, just to say thank you for being my GF. And
                        the thing
                        which hurt the most was she didnt show one hint of sadness when breaking up with me, not a tear.
                        I loved
                        her
                        more than anything i really did, i thought this was gonna be life. and hopefully move with her.
                        She was
                        my
                        first GF, my First love, my first everything in fact. Its now May 1st and still havent gotten

                        My
                        mind keeps thinking of her and cant move on. I try to take my mind away, edit videos to put on
                        youtube,
                        play
                        video games, i have full time job and my mind plays games with me. Mentally lost right now. I

                        in usa. But when a week goes by things pop up which make me remember last year. Any advice to

                        is
                        generally
                        very good. However, there are some personal problems \on both ends, but mostly mine\ that need
                        to be
                        attended to and that I was planning on fixing this summer with regular therapy appointments,
                        meditation,
                        etc. My boyfriend and I have both have internships in different cities but since I don't have a
                        car we
                        were
                        planning on seeing each other once a month. However, we recently got into a pretty big fight and
                        now he
                        thinks we should spend the summer apart and try things again next semester, even though he
                        admits that
                        its
                        risky since it may not work. I am against this because security is really important to me for
                        personal
                        reasons and since we'll be long distance I figure we can both work on our problems while still
                        seeing
                        each
                        other. He says he wants more space than that and if we don't end up together again then it
                        wasn't meant
                        to
                        be even though he's fairly confident that I'm the absolute perfect girl for him. So, Reddit, any
                        advice?
                        If
                        we break up over the summer I am very confident that I won't want to date again but he doesn't

                        me

                        thanks everybody for the feedback. Of course, right after I posted this, I found two local
                        missions. One
                        gave me a lump of cash. The other I went all-in for salvage and got a free Thunderbolt. Make a

                    <td>Found myself in the same predicament Hey Reddit! I posted about this in February under a
                        different
                        account.
                        To sum things up, I got into my first “relationship” of sorts with this guy, and I was afraid to
                        enter
                        into
                        it because I didn’t have any friends and I really mean I don’t have ANY friends and still don’t,
                        although
                        I’ve been trying more these days to make some. Well, the relationship fell apart after a month
                        which is
                        a
                        huge blow as a lonely person, haha. I met another guy a few weeks ago through Tinder and I
                        really like
                        him!
                        But the thing is that I’m afraid to move any further because I’m afraid of scaring him off by
                        the fact
                        that
                        I don’t have any friends. When I was with the last guy, he asked me what I did for fun and I
                        just said
                        “Oh,
                        art, reading, blah blah blah.” but no mention of any friends, and he just said, “That’s it?”
                        Like he was
                        ridiculing me for not hanging out with people on a regular basis, and that was actually the last
                        time we
                        saw
                        each other. We broke up over text. The last time I posted this, I was told to not give a fuck,
                        but I
                        know
                        that a common piece of dating advice is that you shouldn’t date anyone who doesn’t have friends
                        which I
                        totally get... and my lastcurrent situation isn’t helping me with my confidence. I have this
                        feeling
                        that
                        maybe I should’ve made friends first before I started dating so that I could at least appear
                        normal, but
                        I’ve already seen this guy like 6 times in the past three weeks and I just don’t want to end
                        something
                        that
                        could possibly lead to something good? What do I do</td>

                        powers
                        alongside Austria. The Prussians, under the leadership of Chancellor Otto von Bismarck, fought a
                        series
                        of
                        wars against Denmark, Austria, and France in order to cement Prussian hegemony over what we

                        consider
                        modern Germany. After taking back Elsaß-Lothringen from the French, the Prussian König King was

                        the
                        German Kaiser Emperor and the German Empire was formed. Prussia was nominally a “first among

                        was
                        also the Emperor, and most of the German Army was run by a Prussian officer corps, not to

                        altogether I was separated from my newborn less than 24 hours after giving birth with a rash
                        whose cause
                        was
                        completely unknown and never seen before. This rash spread from my stomach to my entire body on
                        my face,
                        and
                        even into my throat within 24 hours of giving birth! I had teams of doctors from Internal
                        Medicine to
                        the
                        Burn Unit trying to figure out was wrong with me. After a week of being in the ICU and
                        eventually being
                        transferred to the women's care floor of the hospital and literally almost dying, they diagnosed
                        me with
                        a
                        rare case of PUPPPS Polymorphic eruption of pregnancy or it's also known as Pruritic urticarial
                        papules
                        and
                        plaques of pregnancy. This rash normally occurs during pregnancy and goes away when you give
                        birth, but
                        of
                        course with me, it was completely the opposite. It took 10 weeks for the rash to finally
                        completely go
                        away.
                        To say this was traumatic is an understatement. I literally wouldn't let ANYONE see me for weeks
                        immediate
                        family included because I was so embarrassed by how I looked. People keep asking when I'm going
                        to have
                        another baby, and believe me I desperately want one, but this rash is one of the main reasons
                        I'm
                        absolutely
                        terrified of getting pregnant again. I'm looking for anyone who may have had their PUPPPS

                        But
                        compare it to a Windows laptop, and the UX is lackluster. Using hand gestures on the trackpad

                        found a hoard of hardcore porn magazines dumped in the water just near a bridge. We fished the

                        my boyfriend has two friends who are in an open relationship. Lets call them Gary and Jane.
                        They're very
                        much in love but they allow eachother every now and again to go and sleep with other people, and
                        they're
                        both perfectly happy so who am I to judge? Anyway, Gary Jane were friends with my boyfriend
                        before I met
                        him, and since being with him I've became quite close to them too, as they're both awesome
                        people. Well,
                        yesterday Gary asked if my boyfriend and I would ever consider an open relationship. I said that
                        it's
                        not
                        something that would work for us personally, and wanted to find out why he asked. Well it turns
                        out Gary
                        really likes me and wants to be a friend with benefits. He wanted me to ask my boyfriend if he'd
                        be
                        willing
                        to let me which I know he'd definitely say no, and it's not something I want anyway as I'm happy
                        with
                        just
                        my boyfriend An open relationship definitely isn't something neither me or my partner want We
                        had a
                        conversation about it a couple of years ago, so I turned him down. Gary told me that I'm always

                        change my mind as he really, REALLY likes me and would love to get closer to me. I'd never be

                        discussions on the contours of executive power meant one thing before 2016 and another thing
                        now,
                        precisely
                        because, as they put it, no legal scholar opining on executive power “considered the possibility
                        that a
                        bigoted, uninformed, serial liar would assume the powers of the oval office.” It is beyond me
                        why people
                        think that executive power should be allocated without assuming the worst of all worlds. It does
                        not
                        take a
                        legal scholar or a historian to show that the Presidency as an institution has far exceeded its
                        original
                        intent and capability. Executive power should not be sculpted to meet the considerations of your
                        side or
                        even of the other side it should be measured against its true capability, and for someone reason
                        now,
                        Liberals seem surprised that the President has the ability to do a great deal, and can influence
                        a vast
                        array of political, social, and economic institutions. Were the same people upset when Obama
                        expanded
                        the
                        use of military drones in the Middle East? I doubt it. Were the same folks disturbed by
                        President
                        Obama's
                        consistent use of Executive Orders to bypass Congress? Probably not. The point being that this
                        is only a
                        normsconstitutional crisis because Liberals now see how these norms can negatively impact their
                        agenda,
                        but
                        had no problem with someone else in the Oval using executive power in similar albeit less
                        disastrous

                        supported each other on all kinds of advice. I enjoyed her company a lot because she would

                        weekend
                        we
                        met up and had a fantastic time. Just went shopping together and then chatted the rest of the
                        afternoon
                        and
                        kissed. He said he had to go out of town in a couple of weeks but wanted to see me his free
                        weekend in
                        between and take me out on a “real date.” I was so excited because it was going to be so nice
                        out and
                        this
                        past weekend would be my last real one for the next month. Plus this guy seemed so kind and
                        caring and
                        was
                        so into me. So I followed up with him Friday night to confirm plans for Saturday and he said he
                        had
                        stuff to
                        do to prepare for his trip this weekend so he had to cancel now, but he’d see what he could do
                        to come
                        see
                        me because he misses me and wants to see me. Since this message, nothing. I know it is my own

                        where
                        the offshoot of one road goes into another road. As a result there are two different homes with
                        the same
                        address number, but on different streets. As a result, from time to time Mail gets delivered to

                        wrong
                        house by accident to the house on the other street with the same number. I believe their mail is
                        also
                        delivered to one of those outside lockbox mailboxes that are all grouped together. From time to

                        delivered
                        to the incorrect address, but the other tenants claimed they never received it. Now obviously,

                        much
                        hassle to get reimbursed by the company for products that were never provided, but apparently

                        okay
                        with that. I told him that I just wanted to tell him how I was feeling and if he didn't feel the
                        same
                        way at
                        the moment, that it was fine. He responds about an hour later saying Fun stuff. He usually says
                        that
                        when
                        there's an awkwardness between us. I would have been fine if he said he didn't feel the same

                        does to

                        okay
                        life with SA, you don’t need to magically hit the off switch on physiological shit you’ve been

                        with
                        since 5. Instead, start to think about what narratives you tell yourself. For instance, in line
                        at the
                        grocery store, what thoughts are you having? “I’m ugly, I’m stupid, I’m creepy. Everyone hates
                        me. I’m
                        not
                        walking normally. I’m not normal.” Next time you’re in a situation like this, gently remind
                        yourself
                        “it’s
                        okay.” “It’s okay is I’m ugly, stupid, and creepy. It’s okay is they don’t like me.” You don’t
                        have to
                        believe it. You don’t have to walk normally or look nice. All you have to do is tell yourself
                        that it’s
                        okay- because it is. This isn’t a magically cure all, but please just give it a try. Instead of
                        coming
                        on
                        here or 4chan or wherever it is you go, instead of filling your head with self hatred, just

                        and other times she comes in with her caretaker and either comes and orders alone at a different
                        time,
                        or
                        they'll come in together but the caretaker lets her order and pick up her drink while she begins
                        shopping.
                        Here's the issue. The elderly lady really can't handle doing things like this by herself. She
                        can't
                        remember
                        what she orders strawberry acai with whipped cream, honestly the caretaker barely remembers what
                        it is
                        either which is fine because we all know, but if there were to be a new person working, I don't
                        know
                        what
                        they would do. The main problem is it takes her insanely long to pay. She seems to aimlessly
                        look
                        through
                        her purse without knowing what she's looking for. She won't let us assist her and when she does
                        find
                        money
                        it's never the right amount and the process has to start all over again. Meanwhile the line is
                        growing.
                        I
                        had to stay 25 minutes past the time I was supposed to be off once to stay and help ring up
                        people while
                        they awkwardly tried to pay around her while she stood at the register. It's a huge
                        inconvenience. I'm
                        sympathetic to elderly people wanting to stay independent but this is a problem for us and for
                        the
                        customers. Would you say something to her caretaker in this situation or would that be rude no
                        matter
                        what?
                        I just wish I could tell her to please help her pay without coming off like an ass. Sorry for
                        the long
                        post

                        because BMI measuring doesn’t take into account the total percentage of muscle mass and actual

                        fat

                        exercise.
                        For example. Someone who is 210 pounds, 6’0 is classified as overweight by BMI standards. When
                        in fact
                        that’s a pretty standard weight. Stipe Miocic, current Heavyweight UFC champion is around 245
                        pounds.
                        He’s
                        probably in better shape than most people in that weight category. BMI would suggest him as
                        being
                        overweight

                        been in
                        bed
                        for about three months, and I've showered maybe twice because I've needed to go outside. I
                        notice the
                        smell
                        whenever I move. It smells like a mixture of semen, piss, and shit, and it usually crusts in the
                        crevice
                        between your thighs and balls. I'm not over weight, I'm 5'9'' 160 and pretty fit tbh. Or I was.
                        Just
                        saying,
                        the crust is not weight related. I've deduced that some semen odor leaks from your balls through
                        them,
                        and
                        your farts produce a bit of shit smell that gets trapped in there. It's arguably intentional
                        because I
                        don't
                        give a shit. In terms of medical problem, I've gotten a few rashes that are pretty itchy. I

                        vanilla and he is very happy with how things are right now. And, I know this is probably insane,

                        rejecting his
                        advances, which means he did make them. I feel like maybe he misses his ex when it comes to sex.

                        miscarried child already has a soul will it suffer the consequences of original sin? does their

                        but we live in a town of about 450 people, so I didn’t think I could do any better. He would get

                        alot,
                        and angry. He used to hit the wall while he was drunk and cry because he thought I was cheating
                        on him
                        with.whoever happened to be in his head in the moment. When we got a little older he turned
                        violent with
                        me.
                        I finally got smart enough to end things six months ago after he put his hand on my throat in a
                        moment
                        of
                        anger. I thought it would be the end of things, but we live in a tiny town in New Mexico. It is
                        impossible

                        friends spread
                        nasty rumors about me. I’ve come out and found my tires slashed on my car. I have no proof, but

                        it
                        was my ex or one of his friends. He occasionally texts me vaguely threatening messages, like
                        “We’re not
                        done
                        yet.” I have called the police before, but they havent done much other than taken a report and
                        called it
                        a
                        day, so I honestly don’t have much faith in them. And now I am dating sorta? a new guy. He’s
                        28m. He
                        doesnt
                        actually live here but he drives through every couple weeks or so and stops to hang out with me

                        night
                        or two. He is really sweet and Im hoping I can make something happen with him. But word got back

                        ex
                        and he is escalating. I had goddamn eggs thrown at my door the other night. “Someone” is

                        calling my

                        considering

                        seeing
                        eachother for about 3 or 4 months. We were really good friends before that for quite a while.
                        Before she
                        started going on dates with me she had to choose between me and another guy, lets call him Joe.
                        She had
                        feelings for both of us but chose me because she's had feelings for me for a longer time and is
                        more
                        attracted to me. They are still friends and see eachother everyday at work. I personally know
                        Joe
                        because I
                        used to work with him and he says that he respects her decision and supports our relationship. I
                        know he
                        does becuase he is that kind of guy. The problem is that my girlfriend is a flirt. She flirts to
                        get
                        what
                        she wants. I don't necessarily have a problem with that but I do when she flirts with Joe
                        because its
                        different. When she flirts with random people its all verbal. With Joe its physical aswell. She
                        says she
                        doesn't have feelings for Joe. I seriously quesiton it. One day she said she didn't, but then 5
                        minutes
                        later she said she did. The next day she says she doesn't. I don't know anymore. I feel that I
                        have a
                        legitmate reason to be curious as to what they text about and when they are together to get
                        jealous. She
                        doesn't think I do and she feels like I don't trust her. We had a fight about it on Sunday and
                        we talked
                        about it later that day and I thought we were good because she said we were and we discussed
                        some things
                        for
                        both of us to work on. When I left her house we were both in a good mood and were no longer mad.
                        However,
                        yesterday she was pissed off again and has been ever since. We haven't talked about anything yet

                        together since 2013. We got back together 2017 in September. When she broke up with me my mom

                        April
                        2017 until 1 April 2018. Then we got place closer to our work, so it saved us 20 kilometers 12.5

                        driving to work only one way. And that place is in my old town where we live now. I grew up here

                        1992 with Planned Parenthood v. Casey. Conservatives had three new appointees to the bench in

                        voted

                        Reinquist who all voted the same way as they did in Roe v. Wade. There is a legal ideal called

                    <td>Hello Reddit, coming at you with a stupid topic again. Backstory to myself I had my first
                        girlfriend
                        when I
                        was 19. She was most likely bi polar, constantly put me down and made me feel like shit. But
                        because I
                        thought I'd never find someone else I stayed in the relationship for 2.5 years. I finally broke
                        up with
                        her
                        last year early summer. I didn't try dating anyone till december. I then met a beautiful woman
                        at the
                        club I
                        frequent and I asked her out. We went on several dates over the next months and finally got
                        together in
                        march. Here's the problem though. I love spending time with her and we see each other basically
                        daily
                        and I
                        feel her affection for me as well, no doubt about that. But I just can't shake off the feeling
                        that she
                        could do better. This is especially a problem when it comes to sex. The first 3 times I couldn't
                        keep an
                        erection, because I was way too nervous. I only ever had sex with my ex before and to be honest,
                        she
                        wasn't
                        that attractive to me. My current girlfriend blows my mind though, I never imagined to fall
                        asleep next
                        to
                        someone like that. In comparison I'm a skinny ass tall dude who's basically all bones. Anyway,
                        since
                        then we
                        actually did have proper sex 2 times, but I was still pretty nervous. I also don't dare to
                        initiate
                        anything, because I can't get out of my own head. I know I should just stop putting myself down,
                        because
                        if
                        I don't this relationship is going to fail, but how can I find the self esteem I need. My past
                        relationship
                        really left me broken and I can't seem to pick up all the pieces. I always wanted to find
                        someone like I
                        did

                        I
                        started watching Twitch for the drops I stayed because it opened me up to interacting with fan
                        faves
                        from
                        the community and connects with other members, ultimately leading to ingame friending and mutual

                        of my
                        time
                        to grinding gold and farming gems, so Twitch drops are really helpful esp. w Event tickets,

                        draft a decent enough deck it's essentially two free packs and a goldgem boost. Even as a

                        We have been through so many evening shifts over the past year, at least 6. Each time we get a

                        putting
                        teas in cups at the end of the night so we can wash the pitchers earlier, proper cleaning

                        our
                        machines, using restroom cleaner on things that are not restrooms, etc. All of this is directly

                        violation,
                        wasteful, and even cash handling issues. Like taking money from the tip jar to give change to

                    <td>We've been dating for just over half a year. She's wonderful in so many ways but there's a an
                        issue that
                        has
                        been plaguing our relationship. This is an ongoing problem that I have lots of trouble
                        approaching. When
                        my
                        GF gets upset because of something I do or say, I notice it almost immediately in her behavior
                        it's
                        almost a
                        180 -She turns away from me -She stares in one direction or closes her eyes -She doesn't respond
                        to any
                        of
                        my actions or anything I say Often times I don't get a chance to correct what I've done. Once
                        she gets
                        this
                        way, it's too late for me to do anything. She's told me before that her behavior is a
                        long-forming habit
                        that stemmed from her childhood. She had a dysfunctional family life and a lot of the time she
                        would
                        retreat
                        into an emotional safety zone and be silent whenever her parents especially her father yelled at
                        her.
                        So, I
                        know that the silent treatment is not of malicious intent, but I still have an extremely
                        difficult time
                        dealing with it. I get increasingly frustrated and often times I will leave the immediate
                        vicinity to go
                        cool off before I say something I will regret. I'm sure those of you who have been given the
                        silent
                        treatment before can relate in some way. She has said before that she wants to correct this
                        behavior but
                        it's been occurring more and more and over smaller things and she's never given me some visual
                        indication
                        that she is taking steps. I just don't really know what to do</td>

                        location
                        that's a deadzone for my career that I've spent a decade building. I mean it - there is nothing.

                        time
                        remote work in my job is not an option. I could certainly find a job anywhere, but I'd be taking
                        a
                        massive
                        paycut and a calculated step back if I go with him. I can't have kids, and I already have two
                        masters
                        degrees so I don't have any desire to go back to school. I'm trying to figure out what to do
                        here. If I
                        stay
                        here, the distance will be unmanageable - it is far, there are no direct flights. I am not
                        willing to do
                        several years of distance, but I don't want to completely give up my career. I'm afraid of
                        losing
                        momentum
                        if I take time off and not being able to get my position or status in this town back. I'm afraid
                        of
                        being
                        dependent on him or being resentful, because I absolutely love my work. However, I love him, and
                        I know
                        he
                        loves his work too. I don't want to push him to retire, and I know he has no control over where
                        he goes.

                        can't see my life going on without him in it</td>

                        of
                        those
                        guys that started reading the comics after getting interested in the movie but I have grown to

                        love
                        with comics. It has become a major hobby of mine. I’ve been wondering for a while if many of the
                        MCU
                        movies
                        are based on any specific books? I know that Iron Man 3 is roughly based on the Extremis arc in
                        the iron
                        man
                        series. And obviously that Infinity War is based on the Infinity Gauntlet book. I love reading
                        the
                        comics
                        and making the comparisons while watching the movies but I was just wondering if any of the
                        other movies
                        are
                        based on any source material. I plan on rewatching Spider-Man Homecoming soon and I was hoping
                        to find
                        whatever comic arc it was based on if there is one and make those comparisons on this watch.
                        Also with
                        Captain Marvel coming out, I’d like to figure out what storyline her movie will be based on and
                        read
                        that
                        before the movie comes out. I don’t imagine there’s enough info about that yet though. Another

                        a movie
                        theater, and there is an usher there — let’s call him J. J is a perfectly nice person, but he is
                        quite
                        severely mentally challenged. Like he only works one day a week as an usher, can’t drive, lives
                        in a
                        group
                        home, and you can tell just by looking at him that there’s something wrong with him
                        macrocephaly, short
                        stature, awkward gait. Oh, and he’s at least 40 years old. He could be my dad! Anyway, J has a
                        raging
                        crush
                        on me. He gets super excited when he sees me and is like “My best friend! I love you. We should
                        hang out
                        some time.” And he is quite handsy, too. Two weeks ago, he gave me a shoulder massage as I was
                        clocking
                        in
                        for my shift. I backed away and told him no, but I don’t think he understands certain social
                        cues, like
                        that
                        touching people like that is not socially acceptable. Anyway, for whatever reason, I have a
                        pattern of
                        attracting guys like J, and my mom likes to guilt trip me for not being interested in them.
                        She’s like
                        “You
                        don’t have to have sex with them, Carly! Just be nice and be their friend!” Sorry mom, but I am

                        for
                        a suitor with whom I can connect on a deeper level and with whom pursue a meaningful and mature
                        romantic
                        relationship. I can’t do that with J. I keep trying to explain to her that if someone is

                        challenged
                        enough, that sex with them could constitute statutory rape, but I feel like my mom wants me to

                        someone’s

                        couple months, my girlfriend and I have been thinking more and more of getting a place together.
                        We both
                        have inheritance and it makes sense to invest in property. We're very much happy despite it only
                        being 3
                        years together, and we both know what we have to do should worse come to worse. Sounds good,
                        right? My
                        issue
                        is with my Mum. My Dad left at an early age I still see him now and he already knows and is
                        supportive
                        of my
                        decision, I love my Dad very much. and for a long while my Mum took all the burden of me and my
                        brother
                        24M
                        growing up. We never had much money but my Mum provided us with what she could, clothes, food,
                        haircuts
                        etc
                        etc and has been there for us when we needed help emotionally. She has no issues with my GF at
                        all and
                        treats her like the Daughter she never had. She even buys random clothespresents for her all the
                        time!

                        get on really well. My issue is that when I'm thinking of telling her about moving out, I get

                        losing
                        my prescription bottle and having insurance issues while trying to replace it. It's been a few
                        days
                        since I
                        got that figured out, and I'm still having really weird symptoms. I'm not sure if it's
                        withdrawal or
                        something else, so thought I'd post here to see if anyone has any insight. It's really hard to
                        describe,
                        but
                        I kind of feel like things are slightly in slow motion. I also have reduced feeling in my hands
                        and
                        face.
                        The face is the most noticeable it's similar to getting numbing shots at the dentist. I know
                        everything
                        looks normal and is working like it should, but it's hard to feel what my face is doing when I
                        speak or
                        smile or generally emote. The hands thing is weird, too touching things just feels different
                        than usual,
                        and
                        typing seems like a bit of a chore especially on my phone. My depth perception is also slightly
                        off. Not
                        super incorrect, exactly. I can still reach things or drive or walk pretty naturally, but
                        everything
                        just
                        feels off slightly. I've missed my meds for a dose or two before and have felt normal after one

                        been
                        very stressful for me as I feel like I'm not living my full potential. I do only ok in classes,
                        and I'm
                        having trouble motivating myself to get involved in much extra curricular activities. In short,
                        I just
                        feel
                        like my confidence is not where it used to be and I'm feeling like I'm not growing or improving

                        person
                        at all. I've had the idea of taking a sort of gap so I can have more time to figure things out.

                        I
                        realized that I want to commit to trying to improve my life in general by doing something
                        different for
                        myself. I was wondering if it's possible to take a whole year off so I can focus on doing EMT

                        why not
                        lower the price of those better pistols, so that the price difference would be up to like 3-5k
                        in
                        difference? Same with the automatic one, it was quite viable and awesome before the major
                        increase in
                        price,

                        it, but
                        the
                        thing is, those who don't want to waste around 150K roubles, aren't going to buy it and only go
                        daytime.
                        For
                        this, the suggestion would be why not lower the price, or make raid time not selectable? That
                        would make

                        They
                        just upvote it because they like it. I believe more mobile users are the cause of many
                        subreddits having
                        irrelevant posts getting upvoted. On mobile people tend to stick to their frontpage and scroll
                        down. On
                        the
                        computer, people generally click on various subreddits and browse that way. Mods of certain

                        don't
                        remove the posts because more content to their subreddit is positive. The heavily policed ones
                        have less
                        content and aren't featured on the front page as much. So sometimes it's not really in the
                        interests of

                        and
                        blasting heavy bass from the late afternoon to the early AM on a semi-regular basis. I can feel
                        my room
                        shake pretty high up in the building, and I can only imagine what it is like for the lower
                        floors.
                        Calling
                        security does nothing - they only go out and say something half the time, and when they do, the
                        group
                        just
                        turns their bass up higher. I went down to talk to management about it today, and the building
                        manager
                        told
                        me that the building has a strict policy against parties by the pool after 9pm. Obviously, it
                        hasn't
                        been
                        enforced lately. If you have noise complaints, the manager recommended that you bring them to
                        the front
                        office so that they can build a case against these people and possibly fine them. Hate being

                        but
                        something has to be done. I'm all for people partying, but I don't want to hear your music in my

                        with my
                        boyfriend since September and we have been going strong ever since. We are best friends and
                        partners in
                        crime, meaning that we have no secrets around one another, when we have any disagreements, we
                        like to
                        talk
                        them out and solve them and we respect each other's opinions, we have common aims and plans for
                        the
                        future.
                        Every time he walks into the room I am in, it brightens my day and I know for a fact that he
                        cares about
                        me
                        immensely. We have already exchanged I love yous and there's complete trust between the two of
                        us.
                        Recently,
                        he has been extremely busy with university-related stuff and starting up at a new job.
                        Consequently, he
                        is
                        always exhausted and tired, but nonetheless always makes time to hang with me and we have an
                        amazing
                        time
                        together. However, we are both very affectionate, and until recently we would make out pretty
                        intensely
                        whenever we had a chance. We don't live together, as rent in our city is pretty expensive and
                        are living
                        with each of our respective relatives. However, and in the last few days, I have noticed the
                        frequency
                        of
                        our kissingmake outs has fallen. I didn't want to raise the issue and talk to him before even
                        having a
                        clear
                        idea of what was going on in the first place, but he ended raising it up today. He told me that,
                        lately,
                        he
                        doesn't feel in the mood for kissing. When I asked him to tell me why he felt in such a way, he
                        told
                        that
                        his libido has recently gone down and that he feels drained because of the new job and upcoming
                        university
                        deadlines. I also asked if it had something to do with our relationship, and he told me that no,
                        that
                        our
                        relationship is great and that he doesn't want to lose me. Moreover, he has also told me before
                        that he
                        suffers from depression and as far as I am concerned, his therapist has not changed his
                        medication
                        lately.
                        Should I be worried reddit? I miss him kissing me, as it is always great. He always goes the

                        that’s the
                        case. The case is im not over how it happened. Let me explain. So we were together for about a
                        year and
                        towards the end we moved super quick. Moved in together, tried to start a familyhindsight is
                        2020 this
                        was
                        stupid. Well things got super stressful and our break up was disastrous. The cops ended up
                        getting
                        called,
                        and while im not perfect. The things that I was alleged with were not the truth at all. I was
                        arrested.
                        I
                        spent 12 days in jail and 1.5 years on probation. 200 days of that was on house arrest. I
                        legally
                        couldnt
                        see or speak to her. Which of course i followed by. I am not a criminal, but the courts didnt
                        see it
                        that
                        way. I did my time. I’d rather not go into detail. During this time of being away i reflected a
                        lot on
                        the
                        situation and her. I realized that we moved way too fast. We wanted the same outcome with each
                        other but
                        we
                        were taking different paths to get there and this is why it caused so many issues. I realize
                        that we are
                        not
                        meant to be together, but i have this void feeling. This feeling of having a bridge so burnt
                        with
                        someone i
                        loved to death that cannot really be repaired. I just want to actually have a resolution with
                        her.
                        Instead
                        of not talking to her. Im torn if i should contact her and just explain myself and hoping to
                        wish her
                        the
                        best in her life. I just dont like having enemies. Especially not with a person I had visions of
                        marrying. I
                        wrote a message I was planning on sending her. I read it almost everyday, but im too scared to
                        send it.

                        16. Okay, fine. Typical thing for a parent to say. I apply to places like crazy for a week
                        straight.
                        Finally
                        I get an interview at Sonic Midwest restaurant chain. I come in 15 minutes early for the

                        of
                        availability were, and gave me a tour of the place. The interview was over after that and I left
                        in good
                        spirits. I wait for a week to get a response from the hiring manager, she calls me back when

                        tried
                        getting ahold of her the first time. She said “Oh right! My apologies for never getting back to

                        Please

                        manager. She comes out with a smile on her face ready to formally introduce herself to me again.

                        but we
                        stopped once everything seemed fine. Basically what I'm trying to say is that this came out of

                        the

                        country
                        doing masters. She is with her family in her home town doing her Bachelors. Lately I have been
                        feeling
                        lonely because my two roommates are on vacation and I am alone in the house for a month. I don’t
                        have
                        much
                        friends to hangout because I am new here. I have been repeatedly telling my girlfriend that I am
                        feeling
                        depressed and need to talk to her. I call her and she doesn’t call back or reply. She just reads
                        whatever
                        message I send her and ignores it. Yesterday she posted a photo on Instagram with her best
                        friend 23M
                        saying
                        about how she had great late night talks with him and how grateful she is for having a friend
                        like him.
                        As
                        you would expect, I lost my mind. Here I am, depressed and wanting to talk to her and calling
                        and
                        whatnot,
                        there she is having fun. I asked her that you don’t have time to talk to your depressed
                        boyfriend but
                        have
                        much time to have late night talks with him? I also asked her why are you ignoring me, not
                        replying to
                        my
                        calls and not caring at all. She said the post was about past when she had those talks and he

                        to
                        post the picture. I didn’t stress much on this because that’s not what I am most concerned
                        about. She is
                        pissed at me because I asked her about that and not talking to me. She couldn’t understand that
                        I am
                        alone
                        and depressed and just wanted to talk to her. Now, here I am even more depressed than before,

                    <td>So for a little context, I've been having problems with my computer since I've had it Win 10
                        sucks but
                        this
                        is a whole new ballfield. A few nights ago, I uninstalled McAfee from my com. It informed me
                        that doing
                        so
                        would remove it from the hard drive, but I haven't had problems with the hard drive after
                        removing
                        things
                        before, so I choose to remove it anyways. Two hours after I did this, my com. starts shutting
                        down
                        without
                        prompt. It doesn't go to the shut down screen to do so, it just cuts to black, similar to how it
                        would
                        if I
                        just pulled the battery if the com. was still on. Just immediate shut down. Now, the first time
                        I
                        started it
                        up after this happened, it took me to the normal start up screen with the loading dots from hell
                        and
                        gives
                        me a message about it being updated. It completes that, then takes me to Windows start screen.
                        Here's my
                        problem though It shuts down after being on for only 20-30 minutes. I took it to the Geek Squad,

                        they
                        want 100 to run a diagnostic on it. Me being a broke ass college student, I politely declined. I

                        we talked
                        all
                        the time and shared romantic feelings together and it was a great time. Her and I started to
                        distance a
                        little because we both met other, more serious people in our lives. However, it was okay for her
                        to like
                        another guy, but not me to like another girl. Once she found out I liked this girl, she started
                        cutting
                        herself and threatening suicide. She told me that she would keep doing this unless I stopped
                        talking to
                        the
                        girl and cut myself in return. Me, being the naive young boy I was, obliged and ended up cutting
                        myself
                        out
                        of fear of this girl killing herself. I figured some self harm would be nothing in order to save

                        girls
                        life. This progressed for nearly a year until I was told by my friends that this was not a
                        normal
                        occurrence. After being enlightened, I tried politely ending things, and then she told me she
                        had
                        leukemia
                        and was dying anyways, so I should stick around and make her last months happy for her. She sent
                        me pics
                        of
                        her with breathing tubes on and a ventilator to “prove” she had cancer. I later found out she
                        faked the
                        cancer and the breathing setup was her moms that she posed for a picture in. I eventually just
                        built up

                        found out
                        that the guy was bringing someone he didn't like. He didn't take our feelings into consideration

                        Since
                        starting
                        therapy and talking about it more I kind of now obsess over this topic. I'm 22 now and I
                        honestly don't
                        know
                        what the hell I was thinking when I was 17. I probably wasn't thinking. Or perhaps I thought
                        that I was
                        very
                        mature. I realize that dating people almost 10 years older than me was very much a poor choice
                        of mine.
                        It
                        messed me up a lot because the power in the relationship was so imbalanced. All of my concerns,
                        worries,
                        likes and dislikes were dismissed in the relationship. I was coerced into having sex with them a
                        lot of
                        the
                        time. Now this left me with overcompensating and wanting to be in control 100 of the time in new
                        relationships. I feel unwantedrejected when my current partner doesn't want to have sex with me.
                        I'm
                        trying
                        to work through all of this with my therapist but I feel like therapy makes me go back to
                        memories my
                        brain
                        tried to get rid of and I feel overwhelmed. The more I think about it the more disgusted I feel.

                    <td>So this actually happened back in 2014. I would’ve been 12 at the time. So I’m my business study
                        class,
                        my
                        friends and I had the great idea of making and selling fresh donuts for a profit. We each made
                        about 25
                        and
                        got to keep some donut batter which takes days to prepare. At home that evening, with no one to
                        supervise, I
                        decided to make some donuts. So I filled a pot with oil and brought it to a boil and made a
                        couple. They
                        didn’t taste right and I thought to myself “oh, this must be the wrong kind of oil”. I thought
                        “I need
                        to
                        clean this pot to try again”. So I took the pot off the stove and I put it in the sink. And I
                        turned the
                        tape on. There was a giant ball of mist and within a minute I had giant blisters on my arm. For
                        those
                        who
                        don’t know, mixing water with boiling oil will cause the mixture to expand and evaporate,
                        creating a
                        large
                        cloud of burning mist. I went to the neighbors, the took me to the hospital and I had to wear
                        bandages

                        tackle
                        cleaningpackingdonating stuff a little each day. Today I decided to take care of the cat litter
                        room. I
                        vacuum the floors, bag up the trash the used litter, and go to scoop the boxes. I try to scrape
                        along
                        the
                        bottom of the box, and the scoop didn't want to come with me. It snaps. Cool cool, I think we
                        have an
                        extra
                        in the garage. Go to garage. Locate the 'ole scooperado, head back to the litter boxes. Try the
                        same
                        maneuver. Snap. Fuck. Well, lucky for me we have a third in my bedroom which I use to finally
                        scoop that
                        fucking cat box I actually learned from my mistakes and didn't fucking break it this time. Done.
                        Floors
                        check, litter boxes check, trash check. Awesome. Let's take the trash out! Oh wow, heavier than
                        I
                        expected.
                        All good, just use two hands. Open trash can lid, feel sand on my feet, and a lot less weight in
                        my
                        hands.
                        Sigh. I broke the bag open on the corner of the trash bin. Cue me, for the next 15 minutes,
                        using the
                        remaining scoop and a dust pan to scoop up litter clumps from the grass and driveway into a new

                        Elijah
                        Wood got this many upvotes, but here's the full story This was at Copenhagen airport in Denmark.
                        I was
                        meeting some friends there, and we were going to roadtrip to see a Tori Amos concert in a castle
                        in the
                        countryside. It was late around 10-11PM because there was a baggage handler strike so two of our
                        party
                        were
                        having trouble coming over from the UK, and I was sitting at arrivals with two other friends,
                        when he
                        walks
                        past us, and I go .was that Elijah Wood?! and one of my friends goes I. think it was, what are
                        the odds.
                        But
                        that was that. Some time passes and I turn around and he's literally a couple feet behind me
                        talking to
                        some
                        people, but I didn't want to intrude. Five minutes later he's STILL there, so my friend offers
                        to walk
                        up to
                        him with me, and so we did. She did most of the talking - her suitcase hadn't been unloaded from
                        the
                        plane
                        because of the strike, and he hadn't gotten his suitcase either, I had been at different
                        airports for
                        going
                        on ten hours by this point. and you can't see it here, but I was wearing comfy harem pants, as
                        was my
                        friend. And he goes jokingly Well, at least you're dressed comfortably for such a day, you're
                        already in
                        your pajamas!. Well excuse you Frodo, you walked all the way to Mordor with nothing but the

                        start to lay out a pile of ones and fives and about 7 worth of change in piles. He keeps looking

                        and
                        over. I’m worried he doesn’t have enough, and I kind of want to go over and tell him it’s ok, he
                        can get
                        me
                        next time. But I don’t want to be insulting. I stand pretty close at the host stand, make eye

                        the
                        check and hands it to me, saying “I’m sorry but I’ve been waiting a long time”. He sure has! And
                        I’m
                        confused because he has so much change on the table, but I take his check with apology and go

                    <td>So we saw Hulk get smashed by Thanos early on, then seemingly was afraid to show his face again.
                        Was
                        this
                        because he was beaten? Is he afraid to lose again? I pose an alternate theory. What if Hulk is
                        part of
                        the
                        endgame? We all know that comic Hulk gets stronger as his anger grows, making him become even
                        more
                        powerful
                        if someone gets one over on him. Does the MCU Hulk have the same ability? If he does, it might
                        make
                        sense
                        that keeping this from Thanos could be a good secret weapon, but there's no way for Hulk to know
                        this.
                        But,
                        wait! There's a time stone! And from what we've seen of filming, there may be some new looks at
                        historical
                        events in the MCU. So is it possible that someone went back and told Hulk to take a fall in
                        their first
                        match, just so he can come back later and dominate Thanos as we all want to see? Sure, why not?
                        It's not
                        as
                        far-fetched as some other theories I've seen posted here. My only supporting evidence is the
                        lack of
                        Hulk in
                        this film. There has to be a reason, other than him being scared to lose. Nobody is paying to

                        Banner, so

                        current
                        selection of maps used in the game. They seem to have adapted what they had from WOT. While this
                        worked
                        well
                        for long-range firing and establishing choke points with tanksartillery, it is less useful for
                        the unit
                        warfare of TW Arena. As any long-time Total War player knows, warfare from this period took
                        place
                        largely on
                        open plains. The reasons are obvious – coordination of various units types for maximum
                        efficiency. No
                        legitimate commander would split up his army into 5-6 small groups to randomly move though
                        passes and
                        choke
                        points. This is the problem with a lot of the battles in TW Arena, and over-complicates the unit
                        balancing.
                        Basically every player is left to fend for themselves, but the units from the period were NEVER

                        to

                        can’t happen
                        with the current map selection. Yes, keep the current maps, but add a bunch of new, open maps to

                        month. We're tired of living in small spaces with inconsiderate neighbors issues with shared
                        parking,
                        shared
                        laundry, etc. Living in a single family home is ideal and I think will really improve our
                        quality of
                        life
                        for us and our two kitties. However, it costs more to live in a single family home both because
                        rent is
                        higher and often you'll end up responsible for utilities at least where we live. We found a home
                        with a
                        private landlord for 925 a month with no utilities included probably 1,000 a month on average -
                        about
                        200
                        more a month that we pay now. This is, when halved, below 30 of both our incomes currently.
                        We're both
                        employed, have no debt, no car payment, no student loans, etc. Additionally, we're both about to
                        get
                        raises.
                        Our major expenses outside rent are gas and eating out we do this several times a week as both

                        work a
                        lot and our apartment kitchen is laughable. The new place is larger, has a reasonable kitchen

                        aggressive before. I went up to my third story apartment to retrieve his things and locked the

                        I took
                        of
                        one of my friends which she tagged me in and he reacted to it with the “wow” button. It was a

                        good

                        attention
                        again. It was weird because he doesn’t know her too well, isn’t friends with her on Facebook and
                        the
                        picture

                        creeping on
                        my Facebook. This is the same friend he randomly brings up, obsessed over her instagram photos

                        myself too
                        jealous. I wouldn’t mind if he did that to one of his own friends because he actually knows her.
                        I also
                        don’t mind him having female friends. I want to bring this up to him. Not only about reacting to

                        picture
                        but the fact that he always talks about her. It makes me so uncomfortable because I get this

                        feeling he’s into her. I know he really likes me and would never cheat and I don’t want to start

                        breast
                        cancer
                        in 2015, and went through chemo, radiation, and a double mastectomy. To say this was hard on our
                        relationship is an understatement. Since surgery, my body has not recovered. I'm exhausted all
                        the time.
                        My
                        libido has dried up in dust. These things are not making my marriage any easier. I did quit for
                        a year,
                        and
                        as addictions do, this crept up on me. I've gone a few months here and there, but she recently
                        gave me
                        the
                        ultimatum that I either quit or she will divorce me. I tried Reddit I did. I don't want to lose
                        her!
                        Last
                        night, she came home unexpectedly and I had cigarettes on my breath. She went in her room, had a
                        meltdown
                        and left for the night. Today, I see on the book of faces that she removed our relationship
                        status. A
                        few
                        months ago I exhausted my savings to get us out of a financial bind. I feel like I've given her
                        everything I
                        could. Today, I feel completely lost. I don't know how I can explain this to her, that my
                        addiction to
                        cigarettes goes way back to being a kid, and that smoking has not only been a habit but the

                    <td>Hey there reddit. So, First a little background story that will help you understand what Im
                        worried
                        about I
                        have met this girl in November of last year, after I broke up with my ex, who cheated on me in
                        front of
                        my
                        eyes and gave me extremely strong trust issues and relationship anxiety. In the beginning of the
                        relationship, this was a huge problem. She was however willing to make it work, and after a few
                        ups and
                        downs, a couple breakups and getting back together, she has found a way to deal with it in a way
                        that it
                        completely disappeared. It has also bonded us incredibly and we both value and love each other
                        more than
                        ever. We have some problems we need to work on still, but she has shown willingness to listen so
                        I think
                        she
                        is really the one and I plan to propose to her in the summer. However, now I have been accepted
                        to a
                        university in a different country. She is currently studying here and will finish her university
                        in 1
                        year
                        after which she will come move in with me. I am scared that my anxiety and trust issues will be
                        too much
                        to
                        handle for her as they will most certainly come back, especially since I won't be able to see
                        her that
                        much
                        anymore. So far, to combat this, we agreed we will both have data plans and share our location,
                        so we
                        can
                        text each other any time in case I get an anxiety attack, and so I can battle my anxiety by
                        knowing
                        where
                        she is. Mind you, Im not controlling or jealous, but sometimes I just get this irrational fear
                        that
                        something is going on and I need to be assured that it is not. I trust her, but its something I
                        can't

                        of my
                        friends, hacking into their venmo accounts, stealing one of my good friend’s identity to open a

                        of
                        credit cards, etc. The tricky thing is, she’s very good at being shameless and manipulating
                        people into
                        feeling sorry for her so a lot of people in my circle are still friends with her. Furthermore,
                        these
                        terriblecriminal thing that she dodid is an ongoing thing even after she was confronted multiple

                        by
                        the people that was affected. However, she denies it every time and act like she’s clueless. I
                        have
                        talked
                        to her personally, attempting to cut ties. Basically asking her to give me some space because
                        she also
                        tend
                        to get me and all of my other friends involve in her personal business basically in helping her
                        stalking
                        this guy friend in the group. But the most important reason is, I’m trying to protect myself
                        from her
                        stealing my personal informations. She agreed but then she did the opposite of giving me space.
                        She
                        would
                        message all of my friends about me asking why I’m being like this towards her and spam me at the
                        same
                        time.
                        I would be hanging out with a random friend and she would be messaging them about me and I
                        didn’t even
                        know
                        they even talk in the first place. I never opened the messages she sent me and I have decided to
                        hide my
                        activities on facebook, snapchat, instagram, etc. because I knew it wouldn’t be a good idea to
                        block her
                        at

                        since
                        I was 10 and had Bell’s palsy for the first time. I’ve been achy, twitchy, withdrawn, anxious,
                        sad,
                        fluttery, and fatigued for as long as I can remember, I’m 23 now. Long story short, I’ve had
                        some
                        unnerving
                        symptoms pop up in the last couple of years. My previous primary care doctor an MD never seem
                        too
                        concerned
                        about my symptoms. I know that something is wrong, and this doctor more or less told me to take
                        an
                        antihistamine, see a therapist, and get more sleep after my Lyme test came back negative. She
                        wouldn’t
                        even
                        acknowledge my protests about the test being notoriously unreliable. Last month I decided I
                        wasn’t going
                        to
                        wait around trusting some lady who couldn’t seem to stay in a room with me for 10 minutes while
                        I nearly
                        cried trying ton explain my symptoms and how downright shitty I felt. I looked up LLD’s near me
                        and
                        phoned
                        up the first name on the list. I noticed he had ND next to his name, I thought sure, why the

                        never been to a naturopath, and there’s only 3 people on this list. At my appointment today I

                        tell,
                        even though we hadn’t met, he actually read the paperwork his office requested from me, he knew
                        a lot
                        about
                        me and it was so easy to talk to him about my symptoms without feeling scrutinized. He

                        little
                        over
                        a year now and so far I rarely told anyone who didn't explicitly ask me, mostly because I
                        quickly
                        realized
                        that it's often futile to discuss these matters with omnis who are not in any way open to
                        change.
                        Anyway, at
                        the moment I am the only person who does not eat meat at my work place, and since I work in the
                        health
                        care
                        sector where there is a lot of wrong information about vegan nutrition floating around so
                        actually like
                        everywhere else, but in my experience, these people believe into their wrong facts even more
                        because
                        they
                        studied medicine I never told anyone there that I am a vegan. Today at lunch four of my
                        colleagues two
                        of
                        which were my superiors started discussing sustainable living and it quickly became apparent
                        that they
                        saw
                        it as unattainable to live sustainably and everyone who tries is weird. Eventually of course the
                        topic
                        of
                        animal products came up and the arguments against it ranged from the usual But how could you get
                        enough
                        calcium without dairy? to the absurd I don't care that calves die because of dairy production,
                        because I
                        eat
                        them anyway. Then of course the self appeasement started I only buy locally produced meat. and
                        all the
                        time
                        I was sitting next to them, not saying anything because I doubted they would be interested in
                        what a
                        vegan
                        had to say about these topics. So right now I feel kind of bad for not taking this chance to

                        do. The problem is that I tend to react to a lot of thingssituations emotionally. I’m one of

                        overreact. Self-awareness helps somewhat. I’m aware when I’m starting to lose control, and try
                        to “reel”

                        way —

                        EQ,
                        and I’m inclined to agree with her. I have panic disorder and depression these sometimes

                        that they make you immune to that disease many of them are not going to give you a complete

                        on it’s
                        own. Say a vaccine has a 90 success rate. So long as everyone who can safely get the vaccine
                        does get
                        it,
                        that combined level of resistance means it’s very difficult for them to get infected by that
                        disease,
                        and
                        anyone who’s unfortunate enough to catch it is less likely to spread it around to more people.
                        which is
                        especially important for the populations that can’t safely take vaccines the elderly, infants,
                        immuno-compromised, etc. Now add in some small groups who can vaccinate, but choose not to. If
                        they then
                        go
                        on to catch the disease, not only do they have to contend with it with only their body’s natural

                        systems spoiler alert for a lot of the diseases we get vaccinated for, it ain’t pretty, they’re
                        also
                        able to
                        transmit it to anyone who comes into proximity with them. Even if those people are vaccinated,
                        they can
                        potentially become carriers of the disease themselves and transmit it to anyone they come into

                        still couldn't go talk to her,too shy. One day my friends said if i don't go talk to her , they

                    <td>Time for some positivity. I did my placement matches today. I went in as a six-stack of friends,
                        with
                        roles
                        predetermined. Any form of toxicity was not allowed and we actively tried to strategize and
                        adapt to the
                        enemy team when needed. We knew the risk of teaming up and got matched against better players
                        for most
                        games. We went 8-2. It might not be 10-0, but I'd say we absolutely crushed our placements. I
                        started
                        playing Overwatch on PC in december, so I had a lot of trouble aiming at first because I was
                        used to
                        with a
                        controller on console. During my first season S8 I got placed in silver, but managed to fight my
                        way up
                        to
                        mid gold. I then decided I needed more time to practice my aim and went back to QP. At the start
                        of S9,
                        I
                        placed mid gold. I was a little bummed because I felt like I had become way better in terms of
                        mechanical
                        skill. I already had the game sense because of previous experience with Overwatch and other
                        shooters on
                        console and the way I liked to research the meta and strategies. After putting in a little bit
                        more
                        time, I
                        finally made it to Plat and ended the season after about 30 hours of playtime at 2613SR. This
                        season, I
                        placed at 2756SR. A new career high and a great boost to my confidence. My goal for this season
                        is
                        reaching
                        Diamond and it actually feels like a reality now. I won't be playing in six-stacks anymore, but
                        at least
                        I
                        have met plenty of great people these past couple of seasons. So, to finish my wall of text,
                        this is my
                        advice to anyone who is looking to climb During matches, don't be afraid to ask the players who
                        communicate
                        and aren't toxic to be your friend. Having someone or multiple people you know you can rely on
                        during a
                        match makes the game way more fun to play. Always stay positive and you will attract good people
                        around
                        you.

                        and the
                        only
                        thing that worries me is the amount of time we spend with each other. I am the kind of guy who
                        would
                        want to
                        see his gf as often as possible. I know that everyday, with our busy schedules, is not an
                        option, but it
                        still would be nice to get the feeling that she wants to meet even if it's not going to happen.
                        We don't
                        have any regular datenights, and all of our dates are being planned spontaniously. And by that I
                        mean I
                        am
                        always available for her, so when and how often we meet is only her decision. I guess I spoiled
                        her from
                        the
                        beginning of the relationship by making her my number one priority - I do have friends and
                        passions, but
                        I
                        have always preffered to meet with her The problem is I don't feel ok with dates once a week,
                        even
                        though we
                        have everyday online contact. I can get through busier time, like finals, with such frequency of
                        seeing
                        each
                        other, but with my gf its like this all the time. And since we both are students and live 30
                        minutes
                        from
                        each other, I don't get why we meet so rarely. not like she has a lot of friends and spends time
                        with
                        them
                        instead of me - most of the time she spends alone or comes home to her parents \they live 1h
                        away from
                        our
                        city. I have already talked with her about it , she said that we can try meeting more often but
                        it
                        didn't

                        A while
                        after we broke we decided to be friends with benefits. This lasted about two years, on and off.
                        One day
                        she
                        confessed to me that she had feelings for me and wanted a relationship or to just be normal
                        friends. I
                        felt
                        the same way So we decided we would give a relationship one last try and see how it went. I had
                        grown up
                        a
                        lot since we first dated and I thought I was ready for something serious. For 2 months before we
                        started
                        dating I had booked a lads holiday and still planned on going but just staying loyal. A couple
                        weeks
                        before
                        I left for the holiday which was about 3 months into our new relationship I had decided that
                        things
                        weren't
                        working out between us and I was planning on ending it after I got back. I didn't want to break
                        up
                        before I
                        left because that seemed sleazy and I didnt plan on getting with anyone anyway. However a couple
                        nights
                        in I
                        ended up getting plastered, picking up a girl at a club and went back to the hotel and had sex
                        with her.
                        The
                        next day I woke up and realised my mistake. I quickly realised that this was the biggest mistake
                        i have
                        ever
                        made and that I truly did love this girl. It's now two years later and we are still together. I
                        have
                        never
                        told her what happened. I sometimes get conflicted and want to tell her but I know it would
                        completely
                        destroy her, especially as she is extremely self conscious. I now know how much I love her and I
                        would
                        never
                        do anything as horrible and selfish as this ever again but I sometimes get overcome with guilt
                        and

                        reasonable as a standard. So they can’t ask people to pay in Ohio for a show in New York. If
                        there are
                        outrageous convenience fees call the ticket seller and ask for the appropriate fee free payment

                        a
                        service. The idea is to make as much money as the consumer is willing to pay for their stated
                        rates, if
                        too

                        there
                        must be a proper channel, where say, paying for and printing at home is more convenient.

                        they
                        don’t have to pay them. This will likely cause an increase in service fees, which is fine

                    <td>This happened over the weekend but I only realized it last night. After years of buying the
                        10-20 cheap
                        reading glasses, I finally broke down last week and bought a pair of good, prescription glasses
                        that
                        cost
                        over 350. Fast forward to the weekend where a few buddies and I had a few drinks and went to see
                        the new
                        Avengers Infinity War in 3D. I went straight to the theatre to get tickets and was texting them
                        as they
                        went
                        and picked up a couple other friends. I had to put my new glasses on to see the text messages
                        and they
                        did a
                        good job. We go in, give our tickets to the ticket dude and get our free 3D glasses. I put my
                        reading
                        glasses in my shirt pocket and wore the 3D glasses as I enjoyed a great movie. The movie ends,
                        credits
                        roll
                        and as they do, I text my SO to tell her I'd be home soon. Before I texted her, I took my 3D
                        glasses
                        off,
                        obviously, and put on my new readers. When I finished texting, I looked up at the credits to
                        catch the
                        final
                        scene. I had to take off my glasses so I could see the screen and so I just moved them to the
                        top of my
                        head
                        while they were still around my ears like you do with sunglasses. So, we walk out of the movie
                        and
                        there's a
                        bin for recycling the 3D glasses. We throw our 3Ds in the bin and go our separate ways. All day
                        Sunday
                        was
                        spent working outside and doing things around the house that didn't require reading. Monday, I
                        go to
                        work
                        and realize I forgot to bring my glasses with me as I hadn't yet formed the habit of packing
                        them. I get
                        home last night from work, put on my glasses and can't figure out why everything looks like
                        shit. I can
                        see
                        better without them! What the hell? Did my eyes get that much worse already? Until I take them
                        off and
                        realize I was wearing the cheap ass 3D glasses and donated my 350 new glasses to someone
                        watching a 3D

                        totally cutting him off. I've never had such mood swings before we started dating and I just

                        what
                        to do. I feel stuck. And even if I do get out of this rut, how do I make him feel better? When I

                        him I
                        feel shitty, he says it makes him feel like he's disappointing me. What do I do? I feel so lost.

                        I think I maybe just don't get enough conversation practice, but she was amazing in correcting
                        me. Every

                        selfish,
                        and to
                        not worry about how her actions affect me, which I understand and she said shes changed so much

                        A little over 70 can speak at least short phrases. 30 are nonverbal. The only form of treatment
                        that has
                        repeatedly demonstrated strong empirical evidence of success is Applied Behavior Analysis. ABA
                        requires
                        extensive treatment to get people to fluency. We're talking hundreds, if not thousands of hours,

                        fluency
                        and still have profound deficits in other areas. Then there are maladaptive behaviors. Almost
                        every
                        single
                        person I've worked with has some form of these. Things like SIB head hitting, hair pulling, skin
                        picking,
                        rectal picking, self-biting, eye gouging. Or the person is aggressive, which is quite common. On

                        end
                        clients might slap, punch, bite, or pinch you. For example, I got my glasses slapped right off

                        last
                        Friday and the kid pinched my arm so hard it bled a little. On the high end, I know people who
                        have
                        suffered
                        broken ribs or noses from being attacked. A colleague had a client try to stab her with a knife.

                        maintain
                        his rule despite our then recent actions against him who also hated us. There was a lot of
                        disagreement
                        within the administration about what to do. But let's not forget the situation at the time. The
                        rebellion
                        started south of Basra 3 days before the official surrender at Safwan on 33. And it rapidly
                        spread. We
                        opted
                        to encourage it at first because the war was still ongoing. Who wouldn't? We were still fighting
                        and we
                        wanted help. But it grew and spread ridiculously fast. Much faster than we had anticipated.

                        objectives
                        i.e. removing the Iraqis from Kuwait, NOT regime change. And so, we let the rebellion wither on

                        vine,

                        content can cause you to have a steady data usage of 15Mbps, while streaming regular HD content
                        can
                        cause
                        you to have steady data usage of 6Mbps. If you have a 1TB data cap, streaming UHD content 24
                        hours a day
                        means you hit your data cap after five days. So if you watch a ton of Netflix and have a data
                        cap,
                        you'll

                    <td>Hi, I've been doing some research on schools that I would like to apply to in the Top 15 and
                        it's still
                        not
                        very clear to me what fit really means and why it's important. First, I guess I should mention
                        what
                        campus
                        fit means to me. To me fit means school strengths finance vs marketing vs tech, student body and
                        general
                        campus environment city vs college town etc. Now what has me confused is that it seems like most
                        schools
                        in
                        the top 10-15 have a well rounded curriculum that will get you where you want to go. nbsp For
                        example,
                        if
                        you wanted to recruit into a major tech company it looks like you'd have just as good a chance
                        at
                        Wharton vs
                        say a SloanKellogg. I've even seen that at schools like Columbia there are tech industry related
                        specific
                        clubs where students plan treks to companies, support each other for interview prep etc. Sure,
                        looking
                        at
                        the employment report only 12-15 of students go into tech but I'm not sure how much of that is
                        self
                        selection. I will admit that there is a caveat here that if two schools are at a similar rank
                        then going
                        to
                        a program that is strong in the industry of your interest makes sense. example - going to Darden
                        for
                        consulting instead of Andrerson nbsp Fit in terms of student body is another thing that's a
                        little more
                        clear - For example, at Haas I noticed that a lot of students were trying out new ventures given
                        the
                        closeness to Silicon Valley. A lot of them also seemed very personable and friendly but I assume
                        that
                        would
                        be true across all the schools. They all strive to have a diverse student body right? nbsp
                        Lastly, fit
                        in
                        terms of location makes the most sense to me. Both in terms of industry and general lifestyle.
                        Say, if
                        you
                        wanted to be surrounded by businesses in a big city than Columbia would make you much happier
                        than going
                        and
                        sitting In Tuck</td>
                    <td>Its not clear to me how fit in terms of school strength plays a role given that the top 10

                        get you where you want to go. Any folks here have examplesadvice? For example, should a student

                        did
                        not ask him to do so nor did we ever discuss it. When I asked him about it, he said that he did

                        doing this, but I don't feel the need to know his whereabouts at all times. I went ahead and

                        wrong idea, I appreciate the efforts that he makes to show his loyalty to me, but this seems

                        regardless
                        of what we tried, and I was always left wanting more. I faked orgasms for the majority of the
                        relationship,
                        just saying I finished whenever he had. Sometimes when he wanted to just focus on me I felt like
                        the
                        spotlight was on me and faked things to hurry it up. Secondly, we did a lot of kissing, none of
                        which I
                        particularly enjoyed, especially kissing with tongue. I just didn't know what to do while he was
                        exploring
                        my mouth and it didn't really turn me on. So fast forward, I'm doing awkward things with this
                        one guy.
                        To
                        start with he tried to sleep with me on the first date which totally turned me off and got me
                        running.
                        We
                        tried things again and he keeps trying to kiss me and I just. feel so uncomfortable. He's going
                        for the
                        tongues too and I don't know what I'm doing and I just stop kissing him as soon as our lips
                        misalign and
                        it
                        fucks everything up. The weird thing is, when I'm away from him, I'm super into the idea of
                        doing
                        physical
                        stuff with him but as soon as we get in person I just want to flee. And I'm 27. I'm very certain

                        take
                        attendance. Afterwards, she'd introduce herself and ask for two volunteers to take attendance

                        greenhouse? situation Me and my wife are renting a property where there is an old greenhouse
                        that the
                        glass

                        be
                        able to take it with us. I was thinking that instead I would use the frame still but cover in

                        and
                        then use the inside as a vegetable patch? This is so I don't have to remove? Is this a silly
                        idea? If
                        not
                        where would be best to go for netting and what kind of netting would be good to cover a veg

                        My
                        coworkerfriend is cheating on her fiance with a guy at our office who is married and has kids
                        and she
                        told
                        me about it and I wish she hadn't because it just kind of shattered my view of both of them. He
                        on the
                        outside seems like a good husband and dad to his young kids. I'm disappointed in my friend
                        because there
                        was
                        an issue in the past where she kind of got too close to one of her fiance's friends, and she
                        seemed
                        really
                        remorseful about the whole thing and I thought she wouldn't find herself in any similar
                        situations. So
                        like
                        I feel bad for her fiance, who thinks they are working through trust issues but really she is
                        pursuing
                        someone at the office. I'm disappointed for selfish reasons because I feel like I found someone
                        who I
                        really
                        got along with on a bunch of levels but I think I need space from her. She wants to meet up

                        work
                        soon so she can unload and talk about it and I'm.dreading it to say the least. And then I feel
                        conflicted
                        because this married guy treats my friend like a sex object I think she has feelings though,
                        which I
                        realize
                        is a weirdtwisted feeling to have given that she decided to pursue him, but it still makes me
                        feel icky,
                        so
                        the whole thing has kind of made me on edge about my interactions with married men at my office
                        because
                        clearly I was wrong about the assumptions I had about the guy my friend is hooking up with. And

                        professional people who just work closely together it makes me realize my boyfriend could easily

                        before it
                        went further, but I'm still surprised I didn't really catch there was more going on before she
                        said
                        something. I consider myself to be a very observant person who catches most things so I'm just
                        kind of
                        shocked and now I'm second guessing the assumptions I have about the people I interact with on a
                        professional level. Maybe you guys can just share stories about how you're married and don't
                        cheat.?

                        had
                        issues
                        with anxiety and insecurity, but it has gotten worse over the years due to multiple traumatic
                        events
                        that
                        really destroyed her self image and life goals. She does not currently get counseling and relies
                        on me
                        and
                        her parents for support, but unfortunately they tend to enable more than help. That said she has
                        been
                        making
                        improvements and realizes that she has a problem, but still tends to frequently relapse into
                        unhealthy
                        patterns lashing out, circular thought patterns about worse case scenarios, sleeping in late,
                        not taking
                        care of herselfour homeour dog etc. She recently left school and a well paying job because she
                        couldn’t
                        let
                        go of worst case hypothetical issues none of which ever turned out to be legitimate. It has
                        really been
                        driving me and her family up the wall, and at times I feel more like her caretaker than her
                        partner,
                        especially with all the work I’ve done to try to support her. Now for the issue at hand. She and
                        I have
                        a
                        pretty normal sex drive, but when she is constantly overwhelmed and freaking out about one
                        parasitic
                        fearful
                        thought after another, it kills all interest in sex for me. This has happened even after being
                        ready for
                        sex
                        all day, and then as soon as she gets home it’s like a switch is flipped as soon as she starts
                        vocalizing
                        everything awful about life. This of course can lead to her feeling even worse since she isn’t
                        getting
                        what
                        she needs either. It is very draining to have to be someone’s voice of reason all the time, and
                        I hate
                        that
                        this is happening. I love her very much, but sometimes it feels like she is over-dependent on me
                        and it
                        shows. I have absolutely no idea how to go about talking with her about this without sounding

                        total

                        hung out had great sex and all but this is where I believe shit went south. She moved in, she
                        moved into
                        my
                        house probably after dating for 5 months. WE both thought it would work but it really didn't. I
                        broke up
                        with her two weeks ago because she was constantly accusing me of cheating, doing malicious
                        things, and
                        complaining about a lot. keep in mind, I never cheated She complained I had too many girls on my
                        social
                        media IG,SNAPCHAT and that I was disrespecting her because of it. She went through my phone
                        several
                        times
                        finding things and just running with it. She ended up going through my browsing history and
                        finding
                        things
                        she didn't like porn and got really upset. These things continued basically our whole
                        relationship. She
                        constantly accused me, questioned who THE GIRL WAS. basically asking who my side piece was when
                        I had
                        none.
                        I caught her talking to people on three occasions, with no really good excuse honestly. So to

                        forward
                        this, I'm sitting here after we broke up and we are kinda talking about everything. She is

                        she knows what she did wrong and she is begging me to give her another chance. I'm sitting here

                        little bitch because this girl really did love me, she bought me things with surprise, she was

                        was sick, when i needed assistance like she was literally always there for me. she is a very

                        very
                        sweet. I cant imagine myself without her and that's the scary thing. I'm also scared though,

                        might
                        not change. and this will come back to haunt me in the future. Please I need some insight on my

                        is,
                        few years back I noticed I have this wound on my head, kinda like a pimple or like dried skin
                        after a
                        wound
                        recover. So I began to pick at it and it will just come off, pieces by pieces. Dry, crusty,
                        flaky. Then
                        the
                        wound would be exposed it would be red some what like it's bleeding. I did not pay any
                        additional
                        attention
                        to it. Few years passed, instead of having only one wound, it seems to have spread. I have like
                        multiple
                        scab wounds on my head now. They're alright if I don't pick at it, it will just remain like a
                        dried up
                        wound. I really want to treat this and I want to seek advise here before going to the

                    <td>The policy intent behind not filing charges against an alleged victim if the accused is found
                        not guilty
                        or
                        have their charges dropped is the fear that it will scare away legit victims who feel they don't
                        have a
                        strong enough case, or legit victims whose abusors get aquitted purely because there wasn't
                        enough
                        evidence.
                        Not saying it's the best, but given your situation I'm sure you can relate to a victim being
                        punished
                        just
                        because the abuser was good at lying or hiding facts. My issue would be with the individuals
                        involved in
                        the
                        legal process. First off, individual LEOs are going to carry around their own biases about a
                        male's
                        ability
                        to be a victim at the hands of a woman, especially if there's an alpha culture in their
                        department. And
                        I'm
                        going to completely speculate and state that any police victimhood tunnel vision is amplified by
                        their
                        training with regard to DV situations. Second, the State Attorney SA was a little bitch for
                        filing. The
                        way
                        it works is this In each county's prosecutor's office, each SA is assigned to a specific
                        division like
                        felony, misdemeanor, DV, and traffic. So an SA in a DV division will only work up DV cases. DV
                        is the
                        most
                        pain in the ass division because 1 there are a shitload of DV accusations, and 2 as I'm sure
                        you'll
                        agree,
                        it's very emotionally driven. So you'll typically see newly hired SA's assigned to DV because
                        they're
                        low on
                        the totem pole and DV is a pain in the ass. The SA has to go through every non-arrest police
                        report to
                        determine if there's enough in the accusation, yes just the accusation, to show that the law has
                        been
                        broken. If the law has been broken on paper, then they'll file charges and prosecute. I've heard
                        that
                        some
                        SA offices have they're secretaries go through the reports and separate into prosecute or don't
                        prosecute
                        piles, and blindly file charges just based on that, but I'm not sure how true that is. Anyways,
                        they go
                        only
                        based on the report written up by the LEO. So if the LEO was too lazy or didn't do a good enough
                        job
                        giving
                        both sides of the story, or subconciously injected their victim bias into the narrative, the SA
                        has
                        nothing
                        else to go on. Other times, SA's file on everything because they want to make a good impression
                        on their
                        bosses and get promoted to more exotic cases, or they're bosses put pressure on them to be tough
                        on DV.
                        The
                        fact that your prosecutor didn't drop the charges after seeing the texts and note yeah, I looked
                        through
                        your shit, tells me he's some needle dick trying to lick his boss's asshole by showing him that
                        he's a
                        big
                        boy and can convince a judge to keep out evidence so he could get promoted faster. Then you have
                        the
                        Judges,
                        who I would say are mostly middleground, even though they my lean slightly towards defense or
                        prosecution
                        depending on their jobs before putting on the robe. Of course there's always outlier judges
                        everywhere
                        that
                        are either extreme defense or extreme prosecution oriented. By the looks of it, your judge
                        followed the
                        law
                        and deemed your evidence admissable. I would say this is what usually happens, because convicted
                        defendants
                        always get a free appeal, fact, and judges don't want to get reversed because, like SAs, they
                        want to
                        get
                        promoted too. So there you have it, my personal overview of the Criminal Justice System. Just a
                        bunch of
                        independently self concerned people bungling shit through. So if anyone wants to take bias out
                        of the
                        system, they have to take bias out of the individuals who compose at system. This means the guy
                        you run
                        into
                        at the grocery store or the lady you chat up at Starbucks. Oh I almost forgot, whenever you see
                        a
                        headline
                        that some Criminal got a light sentence for some crime and no trial took place, meaning that a
                        jury
                        didn't
                        find them guilty, that means that there was a plea deal between the defense attorney and the
                        state
                        attorney,
                        and the state attorney agreed to that sentence. The judge most likely was never part of those
                        negotiations.
                        So I always get a kick out of people whining about a lenient judge that imposed the sentence,
                        when they
                        should be pissed off at the state attorney for agreeing to that sentence. Last tid bit is that
                        almost
                        everyone gets probation, because the courts are too clogged and the jails are overcrowded.
                        Anyways, wish

                        quite
                        apathetic about my lifestyle and potential in the future. I remember a time when I was a young
                        kid and
                        believed I could accomplish things and be a master of the things I took interest in, but with
                        each
                        passing
                        year Im now 28 It's starting to feel like I'm just always going to be mediocre at a lot of
                        things, and
                        I'm
                        not sure if I can put it down to laziness or lack or motivation any more than my scattered focus
                        and
                        attention. I was a very hyperactive child, and for a breif period during primary school my mom
                        was
                        taking me
                        to a psych in search of a diagnosis Not sure if this was for ADHD or even possibly autism. I
                        don't know
                        why,
                        but I stopped going and carried on with my life. I did ok in school, but started to find it
                        difficult
                        the
                        older I got, going into college UK and then Uni UK. My biggest problem, looking at how I seem to
                        function is
                        I cant just stick to one thing. I will endlessly watch youtube videos, constantly opening new
                        ones and
                        will
                        start stop play them without fully finshing one before going on to the next. Even right now, I'm

                        to focus on what I'm writing, which I suppose makes my text seem less articulated. I'll be 30 in
                        a few

                        with little responsibilities, and I just feel like I could be a lot more by now. I have many
                        hobbies
                        Guitar,
                        Gaming, Photography, which I want to start a business in but again I feel that I can't really
                        get
                        particularly great at anything, maybe I'm just searching for an excuse, but I feel I have to
                        question if
                        ADHD medication could really help me here. It's so expensive to go through the diagnosis here in
                        Australia
                        where I'm now living and I can't afford it right now</td>

                        has

                        by
                        her parents so we can see each other more and just other stuff uno. Its not because her mum is

                        my
                        religion or anything, well my family is muslim but i aint really that religious at all. it is

                        when
                        it comes to marriage her mum is just worried or something but i really dont think religion is
                        rellevant
                        at
                        this stage of the relationship as we are definately not thinking about marriage due to our age
                        both 17
                        and
                        its too early in the relationship to be thinking about that. My girlfriend just wants to somehow
                        convince
                        her mum to allow her to date me as like a boyfriend for now. She has brought this up many times
                        but her
                        mum
                        just keeps saying no like there has to be a way to convince her mum to allow us to date! I have

                        her
                        mum yet.When she says that her mum just says then there is no point if your not going to take
                        the
                        relationship seriously, we are but not on marriage level then she just brings up religion again.
                        I just

                    <td>Hi Reddit. I recently moved to an apartment and took my 10yr old Pitbullhound mix with me.
                        Previously we
                        lived with my husband's dad in a house with a huge yard, and another dog, a 7yr old German
                        Shepard. The
                        pittbull lived her entire life at that house, and was with the German Shepard since he was a
                        puppy.
                        Since
                        moving, I feel like my Pitt is depressed. We take her to the old house a few times a week to run
                        around
                        and
                        spend time with the German Shepard, but when she comes back to the apartment she just kind of
                        lays
                        around
                        and especially lately seems blue. She's not a super active dog, and lays around a lot even at
                        the house,
                        but
                        I just feel like there's a difference between when shes at the house and the apartment. She has
                        also
                        peedpooped in the apartment, whereas she has never poopedpeed in the house. My husband and I
                        have
                        discussed
                        bringing her back to the house, but don't want her to feel like we abandoned her. She really
                        likes

                    <td>I'll be honest, the movie trailers looked really cool, then I heard the movie was awful, but I
                        was still
                        really curious about the story so I picked up the book. gotta say, maybe it's me, but the book
                        sort of
                        left
                        me feeling 'meh'. There was certainly a mood the writer was attempting to cultivate in the
                        story, and I
                        can't say he succeeded with me. My critique, and where I'm sure my dissatisfaction comes from,
                        is that I
                        felt starved of any kind of grounded reality to contrast to the largely un-explained weirdness
                        of Area
                        X. Of
                        course, the main attraction of the narrative is Area X, but very little perspective is given
                        about how
                        Area
                        X fits into any kind of believe-able world, other than a few vague lines about how the general
                        public
                        sees
                        it. But were it exists in physical space like what country? where in that country?, how it
                        effected the
                        politics of the region, accounts related to people directly effected by the poorly defined
                        Event.
                        anything.
                        The main character herself is detached and emotionally distant in her recounting of the events
                        that had
                        occurred, both coming into the narrative and apparently by her own account since she was little.
                        So a
                        detached surreal land of wrongness with a poorly relate-able and perhaps even literally autistic
                        protagonist
                        left me struggling to lose myself to the story. Having just finished reading IT chock full of
                        compelling
                        imagery, some descriptions of creatures or settings tempered my immersion with what seemed a
                        poor mental
                        image and a distinct feeling that it could have been done better. There were many things I felt
                        were
                        done

                        suspense
                        as they descend into it. Overall, I certainly don't regret picking it up, but I feel like
                        whatever vague

                        I had
                        been
                        single for a few years prior to meeting her, when I worked on myself, my career, my friendships,
                        etc.
                        And
                        now this relationship feels like it has complemented those improvements perfectly. We live about
                        a 10
                        minute
                        walk from each other. We also spend the night at one of our apartments probably 3 or 4 times a
                        week. So
                        we
                        already spend a lot of time together. Her apartment lease expired in February of this year, so
                        she was
                        apartment hunting in Dec and January. We never discussed moving in together. It felt too soon,
                        to me.
                        Now
                        I'm looking for a new apartment for a mid-summer move, and I've been complaining about how
                        expensive
                        things
                        are in our city now. I'm currently paying around 1,200 a month, and I'm going to realistically
                        be paying
                        at
                        least 1,500, likely for a studio. Today she mentioned that she didn't want to freak me out, but
                        that
                        she'd
                        be open to looking for a place together to split rent. I'm just not sure I'm ready right now.
                        Will I be
                        ready in July, around our 1 year anniversary? Maybe. I didn't want this to be a financial
                        decision, but
                        I
                        can't ignore the benefits of paying 800 a month instead of 1,600 a month. That sort of thing is
                        life
                        changing. And in the past I've thought about how living with a SO and consolidating rent, food
                        costs,
                        etc is
                        really when you're able to start saving serious money for things like vacations, buying a house,
                        retirement,
                        etc But it feels so serious. Like, I'm deciding she's the one. Maybe she is. I don't know. But
                        am I
                        ready to
                        make that decision? We have a few friends who are couples who have lived together for years, and
                        they
                        don't
                        seem to be locked into marriage or anything. But it's just kind of scary to me. Making such a

                        commitment. How should I approach this decision</td>

                        this way.
                        Was a
                        one-sided breakup where she basically told me she jumped in too quickly after she progressed
                        things
                        pretty
                        fast. Never really got more of a reason than that, other than learning she had a habit of that
                        relationship
                        pattern, and I’ve slowly made peace with it. Continuing to see her here and there did not help,
                        and I
                        could
                        never wrap my head around what she got out of it since she was the one who ended things. You
                        know, it
                        doesn’t hurt quite so bad anymore and I don’t think about her as much or even remember our
                        relationship
                        with
                        the same clarity as when it was constantly on my mind. Attempting to go no contact has been a
                        big part
                        of
                        helping me move on, but sometimes things will remind me of her and I can’t help but wonder how
                        she’s
                        doing.
                        For instance, it’s her birthday soon and I’d like to know if she managed to get into grad school
                        as she
                        had
                        put a whole lot of effort into it over the past year. There’s this part of me that hates letting
                        her go
                        simply because she was this intimate and important part of my life for a decent chunk of time.
                        It feels
                        like
                        abandoning an old friend. But it’s impossible to separate from the part of me that misses her
                        romantically
                        and still harbors the fantasy that enough time has passed and maybe she’ll miss the good and
                        forget
                        whatever
                        internal struggle drove her away. And I can’t entertain that or I’ll undo all of the progress
                        I’ve made.
                        Consider this me venting about the people we have to leave behind for our own emotional
                        well-being. I
                        cannot
                        reconcile the desire to be able to have a conversation and learn how she’s doing from the desire
                        to have
                        her
                        back in my life. The hoops I’ll jump through to lie to myself. That’s about the right of it,

                    <td>Long story short, I met this guy about 6 weeks ago on OKCupid. We only exchanged a few messages,
                        but he
                        asked for my number. We met two days later at a park for like an hour. We went on a hike second
                        week and
                        cooked for me afterwards no sex. The following week, we went on a walk and went back to his
                        apartment,
                        but
                        kissed, no sex either. Afterwards, I started feeling him a little distant we haven't seen each
                        other in
                        3
                        weeks for various reasons. Last week, I messaged him asking him to tell me if he wasn't
                        interested in
                        me, to
                        be honest about it. He said he was interested, but was afraid things would get serious quickly
                        didn't
                        want
                        that. He then stopped texting me back. Today, I realized he deleted me off Snapchat and
                        Instagram. I
                        texted
                        him saying he was an asshole for not being upfront with me and telling me he didn't like me, but
                        he said
                        it
                        was ME who didn't replied and felt I lost interest. Anyway, he asked if he could call me and we
                        talked
                        for
                        like an hour. He said he was trying to wrap up his feelings for his ex I knew he had just come
                        out of a
                        relationship, but not how soon ago. I told him I was not going to be a rebound for him, and he
                        said,
                        You're
                        not a rebound at all, I already did that. What does that mean? He says he wants to keep hanging
                        out and
                        see
                        if there's something that could happen. Would I still be a rebound? Even if it's no sex? I will
                        NOT
                        pressure
                        him into a relationship, that wouldn't be good for either of us, but I do like him and he said
                        he feels
                        attracted to me too. I already said no sex and he said that was perfectly fine and he respected
                        me for
                        that.

                        hoverfish,
                        and a
                        bladder fish. When the fish are in your inventory you can't tell whether or not they're
                        infected. I
                        ended up
                        putting in an infected spadefish which almost immediately infected every other fish in the tank.
                        I was
                        glad
                        to see that the disease actually spreads in a contained environment. Then I had an idea. If an

                        fish
                        can spread the disease, can a peeper carrying enzyme 42 heal the fish? According to lore, this
                        is what
                        the
                        peepers are for. So I harvested a peeper fresh out of an alien vent and put it in the tank.
                        Within 10
                        minutes all signs of infection were gone. Idk about y'all, but this makes me ecstatic. This kind

                        have been texting everyday. Even though it's only been a few weeks, I saw her almost daily for
                        the past
                        week
                        and I really enjoy spending time with her. At first she was very flirty and replied very
                        quickly, then
                        her
                        messages weren't as flirty as before, and slowly it took longer for her to respond, and then it
                        became a
                        few
                        word responses, and then no response. Classic fade right? I called her out on it and she said
                        she really
                        likes me but she's just really busy. She also said she's bad at texting and that our schedules
                        are the
                        complete opposite so it's hard. So I asked her if we should just go our separate ways since it
                        doesn't
                        seem
                        like it's working out, or if we should see if we can work with each other's schedule. She said

                        doesn't

                        feels. And they did it all without comprising the spirit of the source material. This might

                        store
                        and try on things that look like this, or search for specific gowns to try on at designer bridal
                        stores.
                        Pro
                        of designer bridal store I get to research exactly what dresses I want to try on and look for

                        potentially more
                        casual event so it's less stressful? In both cases I don't plan on buying anything, but I do

                    <td>In Infinity war Hulk refused to come out after he was defeated by Thanos. Some say that it is
                        due to the
                        fact that he was defeated so easily by Thanos but to me the reason seems to be that Hulk did not
                        win a
                        fight
                        in the MCU for a long time. And now he is afraid to fight anyone, not just Thanos. In the first
                        Avengers
                        movie Hulk was the strongest Avenger. Him simply arriving won the battle for New York. One punch
                        was
                        enough
                        to kill the biggest monster, a Leviathan. Loki was defeated effortlessly by Hulk. He was the one
                        who
                        save
                        Stark. Hulk was the strongest there is. Hulk was constantly beaten starting from Avengers 2. He
                        lost
                        against
                        Stark when he was at the angriest and probably strongest ever. Then Vision is introduced. An
                        Avenger
                        that
                        Hulk would never be able to defeat due to the phasing ability. He managed to break some Ultron
                        bots but
                        every Avenger has done the same in that fight. After defeating Ultron Hulk left the planet where
                        he was
                        no
                        longer the strongest or essential. In Ragnarok first Hulk lost to Thor and then he has seen
                        Hela. The
                        one
                        who destroyed Thor's hammer that Hulk could not even pick up and probably the first enemy that
                        could
                        actually kill the incredible Hulk. And in Infinity War Hulk was beaten by Thanos like a child.
                        Hulk has
                        not
                        won a meaningful fight since the original Avengers movie in 2012. At this point Hulk just isn't
                        strong
                        enough to make a difference anymore and simple refuse to come out. He is not the strongest
                        avenger
                        anymore.
                        Thor, Iron Man, Vision, Dr Strange and probably Wanda are more powerful than him. While everyone
                        gets
                        stronger, Hulk stays the same. Unless something changes he will continue being weaker than
                        needed. I
                        think
                        that the next time Hulk comes out he needs to trust Banner more and he needs to be stronger.
                        Because at
                        this
                        point nothing would have changed if the stronger than an average avenger Hulk was helping on

                        He has not won a meaningful fight for years. Because of this he refuses to come out. And if he

                    <td>Addiction is a very complex process. We know that drug use has a strong association with
                        psychological
                        trauma, it is commonly said to be used as a coping mechanism for dealing with issues too
                        difficult to
                        face
                        in real life. The substance of addiction, just like any other possible cause of addiction
                        gambling,
                        masturbation etc., changes the individuals neural pathways so that dopamine release is not
                        possible
                        without
                        doing whatever they are addicted to. So when heroin users go clean, they are essentially
                        rewiring their
                        neural pathways so that dopamine release isn't dependant on the drug. Hence why withdrawal is
                        actually a
                        thing, you are essentially starving your body of dopamine. But can you see the flaw? The reason
                        they go
                        back
                        is because the underlying problems havent been addressed and dealt with appropriately i.e. why
                        did they
                        take
                        the drug in the first place?. You can think of their addiction simply by saying that a user
                        deems facing
                        and
                        fixing the issues associated with their stressors to be greater than the negative consequences
                        that come
                        with drug useaddiction. This is why psychologists are heavily involved with addicts, they are
                        able to
                        address this aspect of addiction. This whole thing gets complicated when discussing the added

                        his life, and I was becoming so dependant and reliant on him for happiness and moral support,
                        etc. I
                        moved
                        out of our place in March. We didn’t speak for a whole month mostly due to me cutting off
                        contact and
                        travelling for work. We started talking again mid April, and the last two weeks we’ve been
                        “hanging out”
                        with each other 3-4 times and I’ve been sleeping over at our place. Honestly, it's basically
                        like we're
                        together. He treats me so well, and our strengths mesh with each other's weaknesses. He still
                        says he
                        loves
                        me. The only difference is we have no title he refers to me as his ex-gf, and the space caused
                        us to
                        have
                        more respect and patience for each other. Neither of us have brought up the relationship nor
                        have
                        brought up
                        the definition of what we are. He has a huge certification exam for his career on June 1st that
                        I know
                        is a
                        huge part of why he broke up with me because he needed space to just focus on that. I’m mostly

                        that they've got a lot of non-typical Nintendo games coming out for it too, specifically

                        themselves
                        are cited as requesting more violent titles. Nintendo never allowed violent games. It seems that
                        isn't
                        such
                        a good policy if you want to stay in business. Mario Kart 8 - FANTASTIC game. Nintendo did an
                        awesome
                        job on
                        this game. I love that the technology allows for updating a game if bugs are found or to add
                        content -
                        all
                        the reasons games can be updatable but if I gotta download the entire game, there should be a
                        single
                        entitlement of the game with the card, then I shouldn't have to insert it again. I bought it,
                        let me
                        play
                        it. I conjecture that Nintendo would say that this protection is for piracy control reasons -
                        they don't
                        want you to be able to buy one game and install it on 2^8 Switches so you and your entire clan
                        can play
                        on
                        one 59.99 purchase. That argument is made moot by the proof that the Switch now requires a
                        hardware fix
                        to
                        patch an exploit It won't be long now until new firmware comes out and you can install the
                        entire Switch
                        catalog on a few 200GB MicroSD cards. I really do dig the Switch. The built-in screen seems to
                        be high
                        quality. The controllers are solid. My favorite is the Pro controller. Graphics are well
                        rendered and I

                    <td>When I was in elementary school there were rumors that a Satanic Cult operated in the woods
                        behind the
                        school. The forest was pretty shady, because homeless people lived in it, and local teenagers
                        get up to
                        shenanigans like burning down the wooden beam bridges. Because of this most parents told their
                        kids to
                        stay
                        away from the woods, and most kids were afraid to go into the woods. Kids at the school started
                        saying
                        that
                        the Satanic cult skinned stray cats alive and sacrificed people they caught wandering in the
                        woods at
                        night.
                        One day someone found a satanic summoning circle in a clearing, with the parts of baby dolls cut
                        up and
                        hung
                        in the trees, covered in blood. Police were called, and it turned out that the blood was fake
                        but they
                        never
                        figured out who did it. Recently I found out that a photography student who had gone to my high
                        school
                        years
                        prior had created it. He set it up for a photography shoot. He had taken pictures during the
                        night, and
                        had
                        planned to go back in the morning to clean it up, but before he got around to it the police had
                        already
                        arrived and he decided it wasn't worth the hassle</td>
